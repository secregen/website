<h2 class="section-title">Future of Email Security</h2>
<p>
At Secregen, we are revolutionizing enterprise <i>end-to-end</i> email security.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Trust your people, not third-party certificate authorities:
     an enterprise is an autonomous certificate authority by itself and for itself.
     It certifies its employees and business partners autonomously.
     
    <li>New approach to security management: no end-user configuration is needed,
      and the administrator centrally manages keys, certificates, and trustworthiness. 
      
    <li>Employees may flexibly define trust boundaries according to their business needs.  
  </ul>

<p>In addition, we are also revolutionizing personal end-to-end email security.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have total control of your trusted correspondents with no manual configuration.
  </ul>
