<!-- <h2 class="section-title">Revolutionizing Email Security</h2> -->

<p>
At Secregen, we are building enterprise email security systems with the following features:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end email security: authentication, integrity, non-repudiation,
     and confidentiality.

    <li>No third-party certificate authority needed:
     the enterprise functions as its own certificate authority and issues
      certificates to employees and business partners.

    <li>No end-user configuration required: the organization's administrator
     centrally manages keys, certificates, and trust relationships.

    <li>Custom trust boundaries.

    <li>Email auditing without using end-users' private keys.
  </ul>

<p>
We are also making public-key cryptography accessible to personal users.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end email security: authentication, integrity, encryption, and non-repudiation.
    <li>Untrusted emails are quarantined or deleted automatically.
    <li>No configuration needed. Set up with a single mouse click.
    <li>Intuitive user interface. Integration with your email client.
  </ul>
