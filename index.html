<h2 class="section-title">Revolutionizing Email Security</h2>
<p>
At Secregen, we are revolutionizing enterprise email security.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end security with the innovative trust model:
     trust your people, not third-party certificate authorities.
     An enterprise is the autonomous certificate authority by itself and for itself.
     It certifies its employees and business partners autonomously.

    <li>The new approach to security management:
    	the administrator centrally manages keys, certificates, and trustworthiness,
    	and no end-user configuration is needed.

    <li>Employees may flexibly define trust boundaries according to their business needs.  

    <li>Support auditing encrypted messages without exposing employees' private keys.
  </ul>

<p>
We are also revolutionizing personal end-to-end email security.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You have complete control of your inbound and outbound email messages.
    <li>No manual configuration: the single mouse click sets you up.
    <li>No auditing.
    <li>Easy to use with intuitive user interfaces.
  </ul>
