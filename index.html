<!-- <h2 class="section-title">Revolutionizing Email Security</h2> -->


<!-- <h2 id="sec-feature" class="section-title">Product Feature</h2> -->
<p>
At Secregen, we are building enterprise email security systems with the following features:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end email security: authentication, integrity, non-repudiation,
     and confidentiality.

    <li>No third-party certificate authority needed:
     the enterprise functions as its own certificate authority and issues
      certificates to employees and business partners.

    <li>No end-user configuration required: the organization's administrator
     centrally manages keys, certificates, and trust relationships.

    <li>Custom trust boundaries.

    <li>Email auditing without using end-users' private keys.
  </ul>

<p>
We are also making public-key cryptography accessible to personal users.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>End-to-end email security: authentication, integrity, encryption, and non-repudiation.
    <li>Untrusted emails are quarantined or deleted automatically.
    <li>No configuration needed. Set up with a single mouse click.
    <li>Intuitive user interface. Integration with your email client.
  </ul>

<h2 id="sec-useCase" class="section-title">Use Case</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Preventing phishing/spamming with 100% accuracy: a user only receives emails from trusted senders.

	<li>Protecting privacy: only intended recipients can decrypt and read messages.

	<li>Guaranteeing message integrity: no one can modify the original content of an email.

	<li>Stopping careless 3rd-party certificate authorities and their abuses: no PKI is needed.
</ul>

<div class="page-section">
<h2 id="sec-comparison" class="section-title">Comparison</h2>
<p>Our solution has the following advantages compared with existing technologies.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Does not depend on a trusted 3rd-party certificate authority compared with PKI-based S/MIME.

	<li>The administrator of an organization centrally manages keys, certificates,
     and trust relationships of end users compared with distributed OpenPGP.
     End users set up with a single mouse click.

	<li>Guarantees end-to-end security compared with other existing
     solutions such as DMARC.

	<li>Supports organizational email auditing without using end-users' private keys.
	
	<li>Allows end user to define trust boundaries according to business needs.
</ul>

<div class="page-section">
<h2 id="sec-technology" class="section-title">Innovative Technology</h2>
<h4 class="screen-title">Autonomous Certificate Authority</h4>
<p>As the core of our technologies, <i>Autonomous Certificate Authority</i> is
 the new trust model.
 An enterprise has the certifying key which represents the trust authority of itself.
 It uses this key to certify keys of employees and business partners.
 Employees certified by the same certifying key are considered trustworthy.
 A business partner is trustworthy only when her key is also certified by the
  same certifying key.
 For special business requirements, employees may define trust groups.
 A group is a subset of employees to which a certain subset of business partners
  is considered trustworthy.
 For example, the sales department may define a trust group which
  includes sales representatives and customers.
 As a result, they trust each other.
 However, HR employees do not trust the customers, and vice versus because the
  former is not in the group.
